# Power-BI-HR-Dashboard
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze employee attrition trends across key HR dimensions like age, gender, department, education field, and job role and related HR metrics to support decision-making in retention strategies.

# Key Insights:
• High attrition observed in the R&D department, suggesting the need for targeted retention strategies.

• Employees aged 25–34 showed the highest attrition, likely due to early-career transitions and growth expectations.

• Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds experienced elevated attrition, possibly driven by external industry demand.

# Why HR Analytics Dashboard Stands Out:

•	Multi-Dimensional Insights: Analyzes attrition by department, education field, age group, and gender, highlighting high-attrition risk area like R&D and the 25–34 age group.

•	Effective Visuals: Clear visuals charts including pie, bar and donut enable quick interpretation and informed decision-making.

•	Actionable Intelligence: Supports strategic decisions in talent retention, workforce planning, and diversity management.
